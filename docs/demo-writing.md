# IntentWriter — Introduction (Writing Panel Content)

Collaborative writing is among the most prevalent forms of collaborative knowledge work. From research manuscripts to business reports, policy documents to product specifications, co-authoring a shared writing artifact is routine across professional and academic settings. Yet three decades of CSCW research have repeatedly shown that supporting collaborative writing remains difficult. Despite the widespread adoption of real-time co-editing tools such as Google Docs, writers still resist truly writing together: they avoid directly editing each other's text, strategically manage editing behaviors to preserve interpersonal relationships, and emphasize the need to understand why a collaborator made a particular change. Together, these issues point to a shared root: maintaining common ground in collaborative writing is substantially more complex than what current tools support.

Existing collaborative writing tools provide rich activity awareness but offer almost no support for alignment awareness. Version histories record who changed what and when; track changes makes textual modifications visible; commenting enables discussion anchored to passages. However, most of those tools represent all edits identically, whether a change implements a previously agreed-on direction or implicitly reframes the entire argument. Wang et al. further found that collaborators frequently struggle to interpret each other's intentions behind edits, contributing to reluctance to engage in close co-editing. These mechanisms answer "what happened," not "what it means." Changes to the writing artifact do not automatically convey their implications for the team's common ground. Recent work found that communicating rationales for edits significantly improves trust and understanding between collaborators, suggesting that making the reasoning behind writing acts visible is crucial for maintaining common ground.

On a separate front, AI is becoming deeply embedded in the writing process. From grammar correction and style optimization to paragraph-level generation, AI writing assistants are increasingly standard tools for individual writers. In collaborative settings, AI has also been introduced to assist with draft generation, rewriting suggestions, and bridging language differences among collaborators. Yet the predominant design pattern remains per-person: AI assists each individual's writing, but is largely agnostic to the team's shared goals, commitments, and the interdependencies across collaborators' contributions. While tools like Google Docs and Notion have begun integrating AI features into shared documents, these features primarily target content quality—helping produce better text—rather than coordination quality—helping the team maintain alignment as writing evolves. The question of how AI might actively support the maintenance of common ground during collaborative writing remains largely unexplored.

We first conducted a formative study observing student teams during collaborative writing to understand how common ground breaks down even when teams begin with strong initial alignment. The study revealed several interconnected breakdowns. Teams established shared outlines during pre-writing, but these outlines became frozen artifacts once individual writing began—never revisited or updated even as writers' understanding evolved. Writers routinely made edits that carried significant implications for the team's direction, but these edits looked identical to routine changes in the document. Writers sometimes sensed that something had shifted, but lacked the means to assess the scope of the change, judge whether it warranted team attention, or communicate its impact to collaborators. These observations point to two levels of breakdown. First, at the individual level, writers cannot recognize and assess whether their own edits carry team-level implications—we lack support for what we term change awareness. Second, at the team level, even when consequential changes occur, there is no mechanism to surface their impact and update the team's shared understanding—we lack support for change impact propagation.

Based on these findings, we propose IntentWriter, a set of interaction designs to address these problems. The core idea is to maintain a shared outline above the concrete draft text as an abstractive representation of team consensus. This is not a one-time plan, but a living representation that is continuously updated as writing progresses. The system bridges outline and writing through AI-powered simulation, designed to augment writers' cognitive processes around coordination. Collaborative writing requires writers to continuously judge whether their edits carry team-level implications, at what level coordination is needed, and how to communicate changes effectively—judgments that our formative study showed writers struggle to make on their own. IntentWriter supports these judgments through simulation: making potential impacts concrete and visible so writers can recognize when coordination is needed, understand at what level it matters, and communicate changes in terms collaborators can act on. When a writer is considering a change, simulation previews its likely impact on the outline and other sections. When a writer has already made a change, simulation translates its implications at the outline level into a readable representation that facilitates team discussion. Based on a change's significance, the system modulates the salience of awareness, from lightweight prompts to prominently surfacing impacts and escalating to team negotiation.

The intended contributions of this work are: (1) an empirical understanding of how common ground breaks down in collaborative writing; (2) the interaction design of IntentWriter—a living outline as shared consensus representation, AI-powered simulation as the bridge between writing and outline, and significance-adaptive awareness as the coordination mechanism; and (3) a controlled evaluation examining the system's effectiveness on awareness of team-relevant changes, quality of team negotiation, and coherence of the final artifact.
